ZSH ON SPECIFIC ARCHITECTURES
-----------------------------

These are the OSes that zsh has been tried on.  If you succeed in getting
zsh to work on an OS not listed, let us know.  The information in this
list may be out of date, as the developers do not have access to all
machines.  In general, GNU/Linux distributions, Solaris and Cygwin are
reasonably well covered.  Please let us have any recent information
on other systems.  The information for systems not known to have been
tested recently is marked as `out of date'.

On all machines if you use gcc and upgrade your OS you must rebuild gcc
after the OS upgrade.  A gcc left from a previous OS may seem to work
but compiling more complex programs may fail mysteriously.

The format of entries is thus:

	Vendor: OS & version (hardware type) [zsh version tried]
		information

Machines
--------

Apple: MacOS X/Darwin 10.x
	Should build `out-of-the-box'.

	For dynamic loading to work on 10.1 and 10.2, you need to use the
	dlcompat library.  It can be downloaded from:
	    http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=17203

	The zsh/zpty library is not working on 10.1 and 10.2, but is on
	10.3.  This causes the tests starting `Y' in the Test directory to
	fail, even though the features to be tested are working.

	Reported to compile with no problems on 10.4.

	Multibyte support works; you probably wish to set the
	option COMBINING_CHARS, which is not enabled by default.
	Problems have been noted when outputting multibyte characters
	to the terminal from a "preexec" function.

Red Hat Inc.: Cygwin
	Should build `out-of-the-box'.  The compilation directory should
	be on a file system mounted as binary (the mount command shows
	`binmode'). There are various issues with Cygwin versions before
	1.3.2 - you are adviced to update to the latest release.

	Process substitution using <(...), >(...), =(...) may be
	problematic.  Different versions of zsh and Cygwin have
	a different mix of issues.

	Problems handling subprocesses have been reported with Cygwin
	1.7.5.  It is not currently known how the problems split between
	Cygwin and zsh.

	Some of the tests in the Test subdirectory are known to fail:
	this is because the UNIX environment is not completely implemented.

	Cygwin allows mount without existing mount point (e.g.
	"mount //server/path /usr/src" where /usr/src does not exist).
	Path completion will fail inside these mounts; make sure that
	every mount point really exists.

FreeBSD: FreeBSD 2.2.7, 3.x, 4.x, ... 7
	Should build `out-of-the-box'.  On FreeBSD 2.2, dynamic loading
	does not work, but it does with 3.x and later.

HP: HP-UX 9, 10.20, 11.x (PA-RISC, Itanium)
	Should build `out-of-the-box'.

	Previous problems encountered on HP-UX 11.x:

	  Some of the special keys on the keyboard (backspace, delete)
	  have been found to stop functioning.  One suggested fix is
	  to alter the way the curses library is linked in the Makefile.
	  Replacing `-lcurses' with `-lHcurses -lcurses' in the libraries
	  is reported to fix this on 11.0, but is no longer necessary on
	  more recent versions of HP-UX 11, i.e. 11.11+.

	  Typical gcc installations on HP-UX use HP's linker rather than
	  the GNU one.  Configure will fail to set up dynamic linking in
	  this situation.  The following should allow building of modules:
	    DLLD=/usr/ccs/bin/ld DLLDFLAGS=-b DLCFLAGS=-fpic ./configure ...

	  Compiling with gcc 2.7.1 is known to fail with header file
	  conflicts.  Use the HP ANSI C compiler.

IBM: AIX 3.2, 4.x, 5.x
	Should build `out-of-the-box'.

	Certain features will not work, in particular --enable-cap
	and --enable-zsh-mem.  (The feature enabled by --enable-cap
	is apparently present, however.  Help getting this to work
	would be appreciated.)

	On 3.2, for 64-bit integer support you need to compile with gcc, as
	the native compiler does not support ANSI simultaneously with
	`long long'.  On 4.1, there appeared to be problems using
	--enable-dynamic (the default) with gcc (version was 2.7.2.3),
	though native cc works. More information about this problem
	would be appreciated.

	It was reported, that at least some 4.x versions have problem
	with curses - variables boolcodes and some other are declared
	in term.h but missing is libcurses.a. That makes native compiler
	very unhappy (GCC 3.0 apparently does not mind). Zsh now defaults
	to termcap on AIX; any info about this problem is appreciated.

Linux: Linux 2.x, 3.x (various 32-bit and 64-bit processors)
	Should build `out-of-the-box'.

        The following problems should not occur with recent
        distributions.

	If you are using an early minor version of libc 5, then a bug
	in the auto-configuration process may cause zsh to think that
	your system doesn't support the lstat function.  If the configure
	process reports that there is no lstat, edit config.h and change
	HAVE_LSTAT to 1.  libc-5.2.18 or later does not have this problem.

	Some versions of glibc2 have a conflict with <asm/resource.h>
	which causes a redefinition warning on RLIM_INFINITY.  This
	causes configure to decide that <sys/resource.h> is not present,
	which can cause compilation errors in zsh's rlimit code.  The
	best solution is to edit config.h after running configure and
	#define HAS_SYS_RESOURCE_H.

NetBSD: NetBSD 1.x
	Should build `out-of-the-box'.

OpenBSD: OpenBSD 2.x, 3.x
	Should build `out-of-the-box'.

OpenIndiana: OpenIndiana 151a
	Problems have been reported with awk when used to generate
	prototype files for building zsh.  Upgrading to gawk (GNU awk)
	version 4.0.0 fixes this.

Sun: Solaris 2.x, 8, 9, ...
	It is recommended that the system library version of iconv()
	be used rather than libiconv since there are incompatibilities
	in the way codesets are named.

	The UCB versions of the routines for reading directories are not
	usable (the struct definitions are incompatible with the ones
	assumed by zsh).  The symptom of this is that globbed filenames in
	the compiled version of zsh will be missing the first two letters.
	To avoid this, make sure you compile zsh without any reference
	to /usr/ucblib in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH.  You can easily do this
	by just unsetting LD_LIBRARY_PATH before building zsh.

	Problems were once reported using --enable-largefile (the default) to
	enable large file system and integer support on Solaris 2 with gcc
	before 2.95.2.  Recent versions of gcc appear to be unproblematic.

Other machines
--------------

Zsh has previously been compiled on the following machines, but the
developers do not have direct access to them and the reports may be out
of date.  Some of these OS's are now very long in the tooth.  We would
be glad to receive any reports of success or failure on these OS's ---
and, of course, any others not mentioned in this file.

Apple/NeXT OpenStep 4.2 for i386.
	Reported to work at least with gcc 2.8.1 and gawk 2.15 patchlevel
	6, but not with the bundled cc 2.7.2.1 and awk.

Cray: Unicos (C90 and T90)
	Should build `out-of-the-box'.
