INSTALLING ZSH
--------------

Check MACHINES File
-------------------

Check the file MACHINES in the subdirectory Etc to see the architectures
that zsh is known to compile on, as well as any special instructions
for your particular architecture.  Most architectures will not require any
special instructions.

Configuring Zsh
---------------

To configure zsh, from the top level directory, do the command:
    ./configure

Configure accepts several options (explained below).  To display
currently available options, do the command:
    ./configure --help

Most of the interesting configuration options can be added after running
configure by editing the user configuration section of config.h and the
top level Makefile.

Dynamic loading
---------------

Zsh-3.1 has support for dynamically loadable modules.  To enable this run
configure with the --enable-dynamic option.  Note that dynamic loading
does not work on all systems.  On these systems this option will have no
effect, so it is always safe to use --enable-dynamic.  When dynamic
loading is enabled, major parts of zsh (including the Zsh Line Editor) are
compiled into modules and not included into the main zsh binary.  Zsh
autoloads these modules when they are required.  This means that you have
to execute make install.modules before you try the newly compiled zsh
executable.

Adding more modules
-------------------

The zsh distribution contains several modules, in the Src/Builtins,
Src/Modules and Src/Zle directories.  If you have any additional zsh
modules that you wish to compile for this version of zsh, create another
subdirectory of the Src directory and put them there.  You can create
as many extra subdirectory hierarchies as you need.  The subdirectories
must be actual directories; symbolic links will not work.

If you wish to add or remove modules or module directories after you
have already run make, then after adding or removing the modules run:
    make prep

Controlling what is compiled into the main zsh binary
-----------------------------------------------------

By default the comp1, compctl, zle, sched and rlimits modules are compiled
into non-dynamic zsh and no modules are compiled into the main binary if
dynamic loading is available.  This can be overridden by creating the
Src/modules-bltin file with the list of modules which are to be compiled
into the main binary.  See the zshmodules manual page for the list of
available modules.

Compiler Options or Using a Different Compiler
----------------------------------------------

By default, configure will use the "gcc" compiler if found.  You can use a
different compiler, or add unusual options for compiling or linking that
the "configure" script does not know about, by either editing the user
configuration section of the top level Makefile (after running configure)
or giving "configure" initial values for these variables by setting them
in the environment.  Using a Bourne-compatible shell (such as sh,ksh,zsh),

you can do that on the command line like this:
    CC=c89 CFLAGS=-O2 LIBS=-lposix ./configure

Or on systems that have the "env" program, you can do it like this:
    env CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include LDFLAGS=-s ./configure

Check Generated Files
---------------------

Configure will probe your system and create a "config.h" header file.
You should  check the user configuration section at the beginning of
this include file.  You should also examine the values (determined by
configure) of HOSTTYPE, OSTYPE, MACHTYPE, and VENDOR to make sure they
are correct.  The value of these #defines's is used only to initialize
the corresponding default shell parameters.  Since these shell parameters
are only for informational purposes, you can change them to whatever
you feel is appropriate.

Also configure will create a Makefile in the top level directory as well
as in the various subdirectories.  You should check the user configuration
section of the top level Makefile.

Compiling Zsh
-------------

After configuring, to build zsh, do the command:
    make

Installing Zsh
--------------

If no make/compilation errors occur, then to install the zsh binary, do
the command:
    make install.bin

Any previous copy of zsh will be renamed "zsh.old"
                   
To install the dynamically-loadable modules, do the command:
    make install.modules

To install the zsh man page, do the command:
    make install.man

To install the zsh info files, do the command:
    make install.info

Or alternatively, you can install all the above with the command:
    make install

"make install.info" will only move the info files into the info directory.
You will have to edit the topmost node of the info tree "dir" manually
in order to have the zsh info files available to your info reader.

Building Zsh On Additional Architectures
----------------------------------------

To build zsh on additional architectures, you can do a "make distclean".
This should restore the zsh source distribution back to its original
state.  You can then configure zsh as above on other architectures in
which you wish to build zsh.  Or alternatively, you can use a different
build directory for each architecture.

Using A Different Build Directory
---------------------------------

You can compile the zsh in a different directory from the one containing
the source code.  Doing so allows you to compile it on more than one
architecture at the same time.  To do this, you must use a version of
"make" that supports the "VPATH" variable, such as GNU "make".  "cd" to
the directory where you want the object files and executables to go and
run the "configure" script.  "configure" automatically checks for the
source code in the directory that "configure" is in.  For example,

    cd /usr/local/SunOS/zsh
    /usr/local/src/zsh-3.0/configure
    make

Memory Routines
---------------

Included in this release are alternate malloc and associated functions
which reduce memory usage on some systems. To use these, add the option
  --enable-zsh-mem
when invoking "configure".

You should check Etc/MACHINES to see if there are specific recommendations
about using the zsh malloc routines on your particular architecture.

Debugging Routines
------------------

You can turn on various debugging options when invoking "configure".

To turn on some extra checking in the memory management routines, you
can use the following options when invoking "configure".
 --enable-zsh-mem-warning      # turn on warnings of memory allocation errors
 --enable-zsh-secure-free      # turn on memory checking of free()

If you are using zsh's memory allocation routines (--enable-zsh-mem), you
can turn on debugging of this code.  This enables the builtin "mem".
 --enable-zsh-mem-debug        # debug zsh's memory allocators

You can turn on some debugging information of zsh's internal hash tables.
This enables the builtin "hashinfo".
 --enable-zsh-hash-debug       # turn on debugging of internal hash tables

To add some sanity checks and generate debugging information for debuggers
you can use the following option.  This also disables optimization.
 --enable-zsh-debug            # use it if you want to debug zsh

Startup/shutdown files
----------------------

Zsh has several startup/shutdown files which are in /etc by default.  This
can be overriden using one of the options below when invoking "configure".

 --enable-etcdir=directory    # default directory for global zsh scripts
 --enable-zshenv=pathname     # the full pathname of the global zshenv script
 --enable-zshrc=pathname      # the full pathname of the global zshrc script
 --enable-zlogin=pathname     # the full pathname of the global zlogin script
 --enable-zprofile=pathname   # the full pathname of the global zprofile script
 --enable-zlogout=pathname    # the full pathname of the global zlogout script

Any startup/shutdown script can be disabled by giving the
--disable-scriptname option to "configure".  The --disable-etcdir option
disables all startup/shutdown files which are not explicitely enabled.


Options For Configure
---------------------

The `configure' program accepts many options, not all of which are useful
or relevant to zsh.  To get the complete list of configure options, run
"./configure --help".  The following list should contain most of the
options of interest for configuring zsh.

Configuration:
  --cache-file=FILE      # cache test results in FILE
  --help                 # print a help message
  --version              # print the version of autoconf that create configure
  --quiet, --silent      # do not print `checking...' messages
  --no-create            # do not create output files

Directories:
  --prefix=PREFIX        # install host independent files in PREFIX [/usr/local]
  --exec-prefix=EPREFIX  # install host dependent files in EPREFIX [same as prefix]
  --bindir=DIR           # install user executables in DIR [EPREFIX/bin]
  --infodir=DIR          # install info documentation in DIR [PREFIX/info]
  --mandir=DIR           # install man documentation in DIR [PREFIX/man]
  --srcdir=DIR           # find the sources in DIR [configure dir or ..]

Features:
  --enable-FEATURE       # enable use of this feature
  --disable-FEATURE      # disable use of this feature

     The FEATURES currently supported are:
     zsh-debug           # use it if you want to debug zsh
     zsh-mem             # use zsh's memory allocators
     zsh-mem-debug       # debug zsh's memory allocators
     zsh-mem-warning     # turn on warnings of memory allocation errors
     zsh-secure-free     # turn on memory checking of free()
     zsh-hash-debug      # turn on debugging of internal hash tables
     etcdir=directory    # default directory for global zsh scripts
