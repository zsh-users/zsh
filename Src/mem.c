/*
	There are two ways to allocate memory in zsh.  The first way is
	to call zalloc/zshcalloc, which call malloc/calloc directly.  It
	is legal to call realloc() or free() on memory allocated this way.
	The second way is to call zhalloc/hcalloc, which allocates memory
	from one of the memory pools on the heap stack.  Such memory pools
	will automatically created when the heap allocation routines are
	called.  To be sure that they are freed at appropriate times
	one should call pushheap() before one starts using heaps and
	popheap() after that (when the memory allocated on the heaps since
	the last pushheap() isn't needed anymore).
	pushheap() saves the states of all currently allocated heaps and
	popheap() resets them to the last state saved and destroys the
	information about that state.  If you called pushheap() and
	allocated some memory on the heaps and then come to a place where
	you don't need the allocated memory anymore but you still want
	to allocate memory on the heap, you should call freeheap().  This
	works like popheap(), only that it doesn't free the information
	about the heap states (i.e. the heaps are like after the call to
	pushheap() and you have to call popheap some time later).

	Memory allocated in this way does not have to be freed explicitly;
	it will all be freed when the pool is destroyed.  In fact,
	attempting to free this memory may result in a core dump.

	If possible, the heaps are allocated using mmap() so that the
	(*real*) heap isn't filled up with empty zsh heaps. If mmap()
	is not available and zsh's own allocator is used, we use a simple trick
	to avoid that: we allocate a large block of memory before allocating
	a heap pool, this memory is freed again immediately after the pool
	is allocated. If there are only small blocks on the free list this
	guarantees that the memory for the pool is at the end of the memory
	which means that we can give it back to the system when the pool is
	freed.

	hrealloc(char *p, size_t old, size_t new) is an optimisation
	with a similar interface to realloc().  Typically the new size
	will be larger than the old one, since there is no gain in
	shrinking the allocation (indeed, that will confused hrealloc()
	since it will forget that the unused space once belonged to this
	pointer).  However, new == 0 is a special case; then if we
	had to allocate a special heap for this memory it is freed at
	that point.

/*
   Below is a simple segment oriented memory allocator for systems on
   which it is better than the system's one. Memory is given in blocks
   aligned to an integer multiple of sizeof(union mem_align), which will
   probably be 64-bit as it is the longer of zlong or double. Each block is
   preceded by a header which contains the length of the data part (in
   bytes). In allocated blocks only this field of the structure m_hdr is
   senseful. In free blocks the second field (next) is a pointer to the next
   free segment on the free list.

   On top of this simple allocator there is a second allocator for small
   chunks of data. It should be both faster and less space-consuming than
   using the normal segment mechanism for such blocks.
   For the first M_NSMALL-1 possible sizes memory is allocated in arrays
   that can hold M_SNUM blocks. Each array is stored in one segment of the
   main allocator. In these segments the third field of the header structure
   (free) contains a pointer to the first free block in the array. The
   last field (used) gives the number of already used blocks in the array.

   If the macro name ZSH_MEM_DEBUG is defined, some information about the memory
   usage is stored. This information can than be viewed by calling the
   builtin `mem' (which is only available if ZSH_MEM_DEBUG is set).

   If ZSH_MEM_WARNING is defined, error messages are printed in case of errors.

   If ZSH_SECURE_FREE is defined, free() checks if the given address is really
   one that was returned by malloc(), it ignores it if it wasn't (printing
   an error message if ZSH_MEM_WARNING is also defined).
