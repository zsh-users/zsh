/*
 * This file deals with input buffering, supplying characters to the
 * history expansion code a character at a time.  Input is stored on a
 * stack, which allows insertion of strings into the input, possibly with
 * flags marking the end of alias expansion, with minimal copying of
 * strings.  The same stack is used to record the fact that the input
 * is a history or alias expansion and to store the alias while it is in use.
 *
 * Input is taken either from zle, if appropriate, or read directly from
 * the input file, or may be supplied by some other part of the shell (such
 * as `eval' or $(...) substitution).  In the last case, it should be
 * supplied by pushing a new level onto the stack, via inpush(input_string,
 * flag, alias); if the current input really needs to be altered, use
 * inputsetline(input_string, flag).  `Flag' can include or's of INP_FREE
 * (if the input string is to be freed when used), INP_CONT (if the input
 * is to continue onto what's already in the input queue), INP_ALIAS
 * (push supplied alias onto stack) or INP_HIST (ditto, but used to
 * mark history expansion).  `alias' is ignored unless INP_ALIAS or
 * INP_HIST is supplied.  INP_ALIAS is always set if INP_HIST is.
 *
 * Note that the input string is itself used as the input buffer: it is not
 * copied, nor is it every written back to, so using a constant string
 * should work.  Consequently, when passing areas of memory from the heap
 * it is necessary that that heap last as long as the operation of reading
 * the string.  After the string is read, the stack should be popped with
 * inpop(), which effectively flushes any unread input as well as restoring
 * the previous input state.
 *
 * The internal flags INP_ALCONT and INP_HISTCONT show that the stack
 * element was pushed by an alias or history expansion; they should not
 * be needed elsewhere.
 *
 * The global variable inalmore is set to indicate aliases should
 * continue to be expanded because the last alias expansion ended
 * in a space.  It is only reset after a complete word was read
 * without expanding a new alias, in exalias().
